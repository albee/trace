Thanks to those that have supported experimental operations including Alvar Saenz-Otero, Tyler Dorval, Trey Smith, Marina Moreira, Ruben Garcia Ruiz, Ryan Soussan, Jose Benavides, Jose Cortez, Aric Katterhagen, and the rest of the Astrobee operations team at NASA Ames.

NASA Ames' IRG developed Astrobee and its simulation environment which were used for extensive testing of TRACE.

DLR's Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics devloped the original motion planner for TRACE and collaborated on experimental testing and research (not distributed here). Caroline Specht, Roberto Lampariello, and Hrishik Mishra all contributed.
